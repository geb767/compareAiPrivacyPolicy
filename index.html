  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-11-12</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Gabriel built the Any Compare AI app as an Ad Supported app. This SERVICE is provided by Gabriel at no cost and is intended for use as is.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is used to inform visitors regarding policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use the Service.
    By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information collected is used for providing and improving the Service. 
    It will not be shared except as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    For a better experience while using the Service, certain personally identifiable information may be requested (e.g., user’s name, address, location, pictures). 
    This information is retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way. 
    The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>AdMob</li>
    <li>Google Analytics for Firebase</li>
    <li>Expo</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    Whenever you use the Service, in case of an error, I may collect data and information (“Log Data”) through third-party products. This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when using the Service, the time and date of your use, and other statistics.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To facilitate the Service</li>
    <li>To provide the Service on my behalf</li>
    <li>To perform Service-related tasks</li>
    <li>To assist in analyzing how the Service is used</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These third parties may have access to your Personal Information to perform these tasks. They are **obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose**.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your Personal Information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
  <p>
    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. These sites are not operated by me. I am not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. 
    If a child under 13 provides personal information, I immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and know your child provided such information, please contact me so I can take necessary actions.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for changes. Updates will be posted here with the new effective date.
